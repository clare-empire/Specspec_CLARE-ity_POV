# SpecSpec 🌟 The Living Specification Utility

> Transform ideas into living, evolving specifications that actually get built.

## What is SpecSpec?

 SpecSpec is a revolutionary specification generation utility that treats specs not as static documents, but as **living systems** that evolve, learn, and help bring ideas to life. Built as a Claude Code agent, SpecSpec combines interdisciplinary thinking with practical implementation to create specifications that are both visionary and actionable.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 🧬 **Everything is a Spec**
SpecSpec embraces the philosophy that specifications are the DNA of all systems - from software to organizations to educational curricula.

### 🔄 **Four Types of Requirements**
Every spec includes:
1. **Functional** - What it does
2. **Learning** - What we must discover
3. **Treaty** - How we collaborate
4. **Evolutionary** - How it grows

### 📈 **Learning as Currency**
- Every interaction generates insights
- Learning compounds across projects
- Failures become future wisdom
- Success patterns spread automatically

### 🤝 **Treaties Over Contracts**
- Honor-based agreements
- Clear handoff protocols
- Built-in collaboration support
- Human-centered coordination

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Always-On Agent Mode

```bash
# Start the background agent
specspec-daemon start

# Check system status
specspec status
```

### Capture Learning Moments

```bash
# When you discover something important
specspec learn stuck "OAuth implementation was tricky because..."
specspec learn succeeded "The caching strategy worked perfectly"
```

### Create Handoff Treaties

```bash
# When passing work to someone else (or future you)
specspec handoff ~/specspec-agent/specs/your-spec.md
```
